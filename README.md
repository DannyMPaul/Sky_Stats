This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

Air Quality Index (AQI) Integration:
Add air quality data using OpenWeatherMap's Air Pollution API
Display AQI levels and pollutant information on the weather card's flip side
Use color coding to indicate air quality levels (good, moderate, poor, etc.)

Extended Weather Details:
Add precipitation probability
Include UV index information
Show atmospheric pressure
Add dew point temperature
Show visibility conditions

Historical Weather Data:
Add a graph showing temperature trends over the past 24 hours
Include historical weather comparison (e.g., "warmer than yesterday")
Show monthly averages for the location

Customization Options:
Allow users to choose default temperature unit
Add theme customization (light/dark mode)
Customize which weather metrics are displayed
Allow reordering of forecast information

- can u implement these 4 functionalities step by step accurately in a production ready code format that is optimized and has no comment lines
